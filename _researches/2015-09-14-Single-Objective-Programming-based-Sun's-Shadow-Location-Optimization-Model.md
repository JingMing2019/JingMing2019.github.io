Background
======
It was a mathematical modeling problem raised by the committee of the Mathematical Contest in Modeling of China. We, which consists of three junior students, chose the task named the Sun's Shadow Positioning Problem. Once we take a picture of something, the shadow will be recorded if there exists sunshine. Since the shadow of substance changes with certain rules, we can determine the shooting date under examination of the sun's shadow in the picture.

Main Task
======
Our work was to find the pattern to build the mathematical relationship between the shadow's length and the several parameters, including longitutde, latitude, substance's height and the shooting date. After this, it will be possible to figure out the shooting date, especially the shooting place if we were given by a bunch of pictures, and in fact a video with a pole and its shadow were provided.

My Duty
======
In this team work, my work was to establish the model and the difficulty lay in the model assumption made and the parameters chosen which abandoned trivial factors and remained the vital importance. Meanwhile, the knowledge of geography took a significant role in this task, peculiarly the various solar angles. What's more, the forth question which is about determining the shooting location of the video using the model built in the former question required us to recognize the changing length of the pole's shadow in the picture. Considering the transformation of the pole in a 2-dimensional video, the software SketchUp was applied to conduct the [3-dimensional modeling of the pole](http://jingming2019.github.io/images/Sun's-Shadow-Model.PNG) to extract the precise length.
