The purpose of this work is to provide the consumer with a powerful SAR/InSAR simulation software where they can verify the correctness of some critical parameters settings in the real system establishment.

The echo signal generation and InSAR digital elevation model reconstruction are two parts of the simulation, able to verify each other. That is to say, the validity of the echo generation is a guarantee to finish DEM reconstruction; in return, the success in DEM reconstruction can verify the correctness of echo generation.


In this software design work, my work is to finish the simulation of echo signal generation and interferometric processing on Matlab. The airborne simulation is conducted at first, which is simple but rewrite some parts to apply GPU calculation to speed up the execution time.
