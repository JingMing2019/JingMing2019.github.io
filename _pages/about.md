I am currently interested in signal and image processing. Specificly, I possess the experience of synthetic aperture radar imaging and interferometric processing.

Bio
======
Jing Ming is a final-year Master of Engineering candidate at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) (UESTC), majoring in Information and Signal Processing, superviesed by Prof. Xiaoling Zhang.

My research focus is high-resolution synthetic aperture radar imaging and interferometric processing. Specifically, I'm working on [TerraSAR-X image data](https://earth.esa.int/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/t/terrasar-x) processing on MATLAB, expecting to reconstruct the high-quality digital elevation model of urban areas.

I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree at UESTC. My undergraduate thesis [*Back-projection Imaging Algorithm and Motion Error Compensation*](/research/2017-06-30-Back-projection-Imaging-Algorithm-and-Motion-Error-Compensation.html) supervised by Prof. Xiaoling Zhang, received **Excellent Undergraduation Dissertation** at School of Electronic Engineering, UESTC.
