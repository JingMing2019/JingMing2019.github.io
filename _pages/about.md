I am interested in synthetic aperture radar imaging and interferometric processing .

Bio
======
Jing Ming is a final-year Master of Engineering candidate at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/), majoring in Information and Signal Processing, superviesed by Prof. Xiaoling Zhang.

My research focus is high-resolution synthetic aperture radar imaging and interferometric processing. Specifically, I'm working on [TerraSAR-X image data](https://earth.esa.int/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/t/terrasar-x) processing on MATLAB, expecting to reconstruct the high-quality digital elevation model of urban areas.

I received my bachelor of engineering degree at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, supervised by Engr. Bo Chen. My undergraduate thesis *Back-projection Imaging Algorithm and Motion Error Compensation* received **Excellent Undergraduation Dissertation** at School of Electronic Engineering, UESTC.
